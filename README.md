This is a doubly-periodic barotropic QG model written in the Julia programming language to replicate
the results of Nakamura and Plumb (1994).
The basic picture is the spindown of a barotropic vortex with radial geometry and wavemaker forcing,
such that wavebreaking analogous to that in the jet stream of Earth's atmosphere occurs.

The model uses an optimized finite difference code and can be run at reasonable resolution
(I usually use 256x256) on a laptop.
